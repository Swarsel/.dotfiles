This literate configuration file holds the entirety of all configuration files for both NixOS as well as home-manager across all machines that I currently use. It also holds an extensive Emacs configuration.

I used to have two separate files (=Emacs.org= and =Nixos.org=) because the NixOS setting for installing Emacs packages used to break if it found UTF-8 characters in =.el= files but not in =.org= files. Hence I used to pass =Emacs.org= to that function rather than =init.el=. This seems to be fixed now however and I was finally able to consolidate both files into one.

This configuration is part of a NixOS system that is (nearly) fully declarative and can be found here:

- [[https:github.com/Swarsel/.dotfiles][~SwarselSystems~ on github.com]]
- [[https:swagit.swarsel.win/Swarsel/.dotfiles][~SwarselSystems~ on swagit.swarsel.win]]

This literate configuration lets me explain my choices to my future self as well as you, the reader. I go to great lengths to explain the choices for all configuration steps that I take in order for me to pay due diligence in crafting my setup, and not simply copying big chunks of other peoples code. Also, the literate configuration approach is very convenient to me as I only need to keep of (ideally) a single file to manage all of my configuration. I hope that this documentation will make it easier for beginners to get into Emacs and NixOS as I know it can be a struggle in the beginning.

** How to use this document
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:6f4b190c-fe69-47a3-9df2-ee429bd9b48b
:END:

When I started out with nix, it was a painful time. For a beginner, the available resources tend to be too detailed or assume too much prior knowledge. Also, it is a (sad) fact that using nix requires the user to understand it pretty well before most things start to make sense.

That is the reason why I keep this configuration as a literate one: so that I am able to explain how everything works. In the start, it was my goal to keep this repo simple, so that it would be easy to understand when seen by a beginner. However, over time I have implemented more and more complicated solutions. Still, I try to keep the prosaic descriptions sufficient.

For a beginner, I recommend to read this file like a book, from start to finish. I will try to explain concepts whenever they first come up, and will regularly link to [[#h:8ea35dcc-ef94-4c10-9112-8be8efd6f424][Appendix C: Explanations to nix functions and operators]] when more context is needed. For the first few times that I am using a new function, I will place such a link again. However, to keep the writing of this file manageable, I will generally only do this no more than three times.

** Structure of this file
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:bcc3ebbe-df8a-46bd-b42d-73aad6fc66e5
:END:

This file is structured as follows:

- [[#h:a86fe971-f169-4052-aacf-15e0f267c6cd][Introduction (no code)]]
  This is the block you are currently in. It holds no code that actually builds the system, it just outlines the general approach and explains my rough mentality

- [[#h:c7588c0d-2528-485d-b2df-04d6336428d7][flake.nix]]
  This block holds everything related to the heart of the nix side of the configuration - the =flake.nix= file.

- [[#h:02cd20be-1ffa-4904-9d5a-da5a89ba1421][System]]
  This section holds all configuration options that apply to NixOS or home-manager. In other words, here we are doing system and user level configuration.

- [[#h:ed4cd05c-0879-41c6-bc39-3f1246a96f04][Emacs]]
  This section defines my Emacs configuration. For a while, I considered to use rycee's =emacs-init= module ([[https://github.com/nix-community/nur-combined/blob/master/repos/rycee/hm-modules/emacs-init.nix]]) to manage my Emacs configuration; I have since come to the conclusion that this would be a bad idea: at the moment, even though it might seem as I am very bound to the configuration file that you are currently reading, if I ever decide to change how I run my system, I can simply take the generated =.nix= and =.el= files and put them wherever I need them. This file only simplifies that generation without putting further restrictions on my. If I were however to switch to =emacs-init= then I would be indeed to some level confined to the nix ecosystem with my Emacs configuration, as I would no longer have a valid =.org= file to manage it with, instead generating an =init.el= directly from nix code. I like to keep that level of freedom for potential future use. Also, you will notice there is no package system setup in this configuration. This is because packages are automatically handled on the NixOS side by parsing the generated =init.el= file for package installs.

  My emacs is built using the emacs-overlay nix flake, which builds a bleeding edge emacs on wayland (pgtk) with utilities like treesitter support. By executing the below source block, the current build setting can be updated at any time, and you can see my most up-to-date build options (last updated: {{{revision-date}}})

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :exports both

  system-configuration-options

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: --prefix=/nix/store/lymgpfqr5dp1wc0khbcbhhjnxq8ccsy9-emacs-pgtk-20240521.0 --disable-build-details --with-modules --with-pgtk --with-compress-install --with-toolkit-scroll-bars --with-native-compilation --without-imagemagick --with-mailutils --without-small-ja-dic --with-tree-sitter --without-xinput2 --with-xwidgets --with-dbus --with-selinux

This file is not loaded by Emacs directly as the configuration (even though this would be possible) - instead, it generates two more files:

- =early-init.el=
  This file handle startup optimization and sets up the basic frame that I will be working in.

- =init.el=
  This file handles the rest of the Emacs configuration.

By using the configuration offered by this file, the file you are reading right now (=SwarselSystems.org=) will not be freshly tangled on every file save, as this slows down emacs over time. However, when you clone this configuration yourself and have not yet activated it, you need to tangle the file yourself. This can be done using the general keybind =C-c C-v t= or my personal chord =C-SPC o t=. Alternatively, execute the following block:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :export both :results silent

  (org-babel-tangle)

#+end_src

The =.html= version of this page can be generated by calling the chord =C-SPC o e=, or by executing the below block

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :export both :results silent

  (org-html-export-to-html)

#+end_src

The web version is useful because it allows navigation using org-mode links, which makes the configuration easier to follow (I hope!).
Lastly, I add this javascript bit to the file in order to have a darkmode toggle when exporting to html:

#+begin_src elisp :noweb yes :exports both :results html
  (concat
   "<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/darkmode-js@1.5.7/lib/darkmode-js.min.js\"></script>\n"
   "<script>\n"
   "function addDarkmodeWidget() {\n"
   "new Darkmode().showWidget();\n"
   "}\n"
   "window.addEventListener('load', addDarkmodeWidget);\n"
   "</script>")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_export html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/darkmode-js@1.5.7/lib/darkmode-js.min.js"></script>
<script>
function addDarkmodeWidget() {
new Darkmode().showWidget();
}
window.addEventListener('load', addDarkmodeWidget);
</script>
#+end_export


  This section hold code that can be templated at other parts of the configuration. This is mostly used for the NixOS side of the configuration where I define my host systems that usually have a lot in common.

- [[#h:8fc9f66a-7412-4091-8dee-a06f897baf67][Appendix A: Supplementary Files]]
  This section holds files that are not written in nix but are still referenced in the configuration in some way. This is mostly used for configuration of programs that have no native nix support, like tridactyl. Note that shell scripts are still defined under their respective entry in [[#h:64a5cc16-6b16-4802-b421-c67ccef853e1][Packages]].

- Historical Note: Noweb-Ref blocks

These blocks were used in several places throughout the configurations, but not on all machines necessarily. For example, the theming section used need to be in a NixOS block on NixOS machines but in a home-manager block on non-NixOS.

Originally, I used this method a lot throughout my configuration. However, as my knowledge of NixOS grew, I have been weeding these snippets out more and more as I find more efficient native solutions. Now, only the theming block remains. For example, the above problem can be solved by defining a =theme= attribute set and using =lib.recursiveUpdate= as shown in [[#h:79f7150f-b162-4f57-abdf-07f40dffd932][Shared Configuration Options (holds firefox & stylix config parts)]] and [[#h:a92318cd-413e-4e78-a478-e63b09df019c][Theme (stylix)]].

As such, this served to reduce code duplication in this file. The tangled files experienced no size reduction, since noweb-ref only substitutes these blocks in.

For archival reasons, here is shown how to use a noweb-ref block, in case I ever decide to use it again, or it is interesting to you:


#+begin_src nix-ts :tangle no :noweb-ref blockName
  enable = true;
#+end_src

which can then be used in a block like:

#+begin_src nix-ts :tangle no :noweb yes
  <<blockName>>
#+end_src

not that noweb-reffed blocks will not be indented correctly. You will want to account for that when checking your nix flake with the formatter of your choice. Personally, I have solved this issue using the functions defined in [[#h:59d4306e-9b73-4b2c-b039-6a6518c357fc][org-mode: Upon-save actions (Auto-tangle, export to html, formatting)]]. Originally, I also automatically exported to html there, but it incurred a too high memory penalty which made Emacs become sluggish over time.

** TODO Structure of this flake
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:2c5529ed-e6d9-44b6-b0d3-5bf96a6bed64
:END:

The structure of this flake as seen many revisions, however lately I have settled on a system that I have grown to like:

  - =hosts=: This folder is used to house all configurations that are used across the infrastructure. At the top level, it splits into the subfolders =nixos=, =home=, =darwin=, and =android=. These folders specify the mode that the configuration is running in:
    - nixos: Full NixOS host (may or may not also use home-manager)
    - darwin: Host that uses NixOS on MacOS (may or may not use home-manager)
    - home: Host that uses only home-manager (no full NixOS)
    - android: Phone using nix-on-droid (may or may not use home-manager)

  The corresponding configurations are automatically generated by =mkFullHostConfigs= and =mkHalfHostConfigs=. A "full" host either in the nixos or darwin folder, while a "half" host is in either of home or android. This has to do with the scheme in which these configurations are generated.

  These <hosttype> folders hold in turn a number of <hostname> folders, the actual configurations. At this time, the files stored in this folder are:
    - default.nix:
      This file holds the abstracted configuration of the host. This should mostly be enabling [[#h:f0f1c961-3e7a-47b8-99ab-1654bb45dffc][Profiles]] as well as setting some [[#h:f4f22166-e345-43e6-b15f-b7f5bb886554][Shared Configuration Options]].
    - hardware-config.nix:
      It is not clearly defined what I hold in this file. Mostly it is just the attributes that nix originally sets when setting up the system for the first time (although at this time modified by me!), bar any filesystem configuration. This makes my deployment in [[#h:74db57ae-0bb9-4257-84be-eddbc85130dd][swarsel-bootstrap]] a little bit simpler.
    - disk-config.nix
      Holds the aforementioned filesystem configuration and is applied using [[https://github.com/nix-community/disko][disko]].

    - The hosts/<hosttype>/<hostname> folders may also have a =secrets= folder, under which a single file =pii.nix.enc= can be stored. As the name suggests, this file should be encrypted. Specifically, it needs to be a [[https://github.com/getsops/sops][sops]]-encrypted file (sops does not seem to suggest a file ending other than .yml or others, which is not verbose enough for me, so I went with =.enc=).  This file should have the structure of a nix expression, e.g.:

  #+begin_src nix-ts :tangle no
    {
      my_value = 2;
      my_attrSet = {
        enable = true;
      };
    }
  #+end_src

      Using the mechanisms in [[#h:82b8ede2-02d8-4c43-8952-7200ebd4dc23][PII management]] (which in turn uses [[#h:87c7893e-e946-4fc0-8973-1ca27d15cf0e][extra-builtins]] and [[#h:315e6ef6-27d5-4cd8-85ff-053eabe60ddb][sops-decrypt-and-cache]]), these files are decrypted during evaluation time and stored under a persistent directory. As the name suggests, I am using these files to store personally identifiable information - these "secrets" are stored world-readable in the nix store. As such, this should not be used to store important secrets, but rather information that you would not like everyone on the internet to easily find in your git repo.

  - =modules=
    This folder holds the most part of the actual system configuration done in this repository. At some point I thought it was cool to have my whole configuration exposed under the flakes =nixosModules=, which is indeed achieved (its usefulness is however debatable). In any way, this folder splits up as:
    - nixos: Holds true NixOS configuration
    - home: Holds configuration to be used by home-manager (either as a NixOS submodule or not)
    - darwin: Holds configuration for nix-darwin. This folder further splits up into a nixos and a home folder, which hold respective nix or home-manager configuration for nix-darwin.
    - iso: Holds specific configuration for my installer ISO that I do not want to have loaded in the rest of the configuration.

    The nixos and home folders further split up:

      - common: Configuration that can be used by all hosts (TODO: this currently includes configuration used by my user devices, which will mostly not be used by servers)
      - server: Configuration to be used on servers
      - optional: Configuration that will be used rather rarely

      This structure is very optionated and highly subjective. I will possibly change this in the future.

    By themselves, most of the files in the modules folder will not do anything. In order for them to do something, their corresponding =config.swarselsystems.modules= attribute needs to be enabled. This is done using...

  - =profiles=: This folder splits up into =home= and =nixos= subfolders, where groupings of module enablers are stored for the respective home and nix setups. Note that =home= profiles are also used in NixOS setups (extensively even)!

  - =nix=: This special folder holds mostly =.nix= files that are not automatically loaded, but rather setup specific things that affect most of the flake. For example, here lies the aforementioned [[#h:87c7893e-e946-4fc0-8973-1ca27d15cf0e][extra-builtins]] as well as the setup for the [[*Globals][Globals]] system. TODO: Move flake-parts units there and explain them here.

  - =lib=: This folder holds utility functions that I add to the nixpkgs library under the =swarselsystems= attribute set. An example would be the =mkIfElse= function.

  - =pkgs=: This folder holds derivations (mostly packages) that I define myself. This is mostly used to grab versions that are not (yet) in nixpkgs, or modified versions of another package. Each derivation in this folder is in turn in its own folder which holds a defautlt.nix. Using the mechanism in [[#h:64a5cc16-6b16-4802-b421-c67ccef853e1][Packages]], these are automatically built and available to all configurations (packages still need to be installed e.g. in =environment.systemPackages=)

  - =checks=: Holds a file that defines my pre-commit-hook checks. TODO: move this to /nix probably

  - =scripts=: This folder holds a bunch of shell scripts that I use for various tasks. Nearly all of these are made into a derivation using =pkgs.writeShellApplication=. In the future (TODO?), I might convert these to native nix, but in the past I kept the as true shellfiles in case I ever wanted to move away from nix. This is becoming less and less likely, however. And even in case that this would happen, I could retrieve these files from the nix store and would simply have to remove the nix store paths.

  - =secrets=: Unlike the similar folder under =hosts=, this folder holds actual sops-encrypted secrets that are created at activation time and not in the nix store. The folder splits up into a bunch of <hostname> folders, as well as a =repo= folder, which holds another =pii.nix.enc=, which holds global PII's, and a =certs= folder that holds some longer certificate style secrets.

  - =overlays=: This holds a single =default.nix= that defines the overlay I am using in my configuration. It is responsible for adding my defined packages and modifications to the final nixpkgs. Also I add some other conveniences like all past stable nixpkgs and some other package sets.

  - =programs=: This folder holds configurations for various programs (most notably emacs' =init.el= and =early-init.el=), that are being rendered using org-babel and loaded using nix.

  - =wallpaper=: Holds wallpapers and profile pictures.

  - =topology=: Holds the configuration used by [[https://github.com/oddlama/nix-topology][nix-topology]].

** Manual steps when setting up a new machine

#+begin_src markdown :noweb yes :exports both :results html
  These steps are required when setting up a normal NixOS host:

  <<setup>>

  If the new machine is a work machine, these steps are additionally needed:

  <<worksetup>>

  If the new machine is home-manager only, perform these steps:

  <<homemanageronlysetup>>
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_export html
These steps are required when setting up a normal NixOS host:

- setup yubikey (automatic yubikey enrollment is not yet supported by `disko`):
  - `systemd-cryptenroll --fido2-device=auto /dev/<device, e.g. 'nvme0n1p2'>`

If the new machine is a work machine, these steps are additionally needed:

- setup the work VPN:
  - using the laptop certificate `.pem` as User cert and private key (CA cert: none)
  - vpn gateway is found in `nixosConfig.repo.secrets.local.work.vpnGateway`
- setup gpgsm for signing of mails using S/MIME:
  - `gpgsm --import ~/Certificates/<certname>.p12`
  - `gpgsm --import ~/Certificates/harica-root.pem`
  - `gpgsm --import ~/Certificates/harica-intermediate.pem`
  - `gpgsm --list-keys --with-validation "HARICA Client RSA Root CA 2021"`
    - trust the certificate and set passphrase
- setup pizauth for microsoft mail sync (account names are possibly `uni` and `work`):
  - `pizauth auth <account name, e.g. 'work'>`
  - `pizauth dump > ~/.pizauth.state`

If the new machine is home-manager only, perform these steps:

- (Optional) Install openssh-server
- Set hostname to the name specified in the home-manager configuration
- Install nix, either:
  - (if upgrading existing nix) Install nix version matching with version that `nix-plugins` is compiled against: `nix-env --install --file '<nixpkgs>' cacert -I nixpkgs=channel:nixpkgs-unstable --attr nixVersions.nix_x_yy`
  - (or installing nix freshly):
    - Grab the link to the install script of the needed nix version from https://releases.nixos.org/?prefix=nix, e.g. https://releases.nixos.org/nix/nix-2.30.1/install
    - `bash <(curl -L https://releases.nixos.org/nix/nix-x-yy-y/install) --daemon`
- add the following to /etc/nix/nix.conf to become a trusted user: `trusted-users = @wheel root swarsel`
- For the first build:
  1) Clone dotfile repo & change into it
  2) `nix --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' develop`
  3) `home-manager --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' switch --flake .#$(hostname) --show-trace`

* flake.nix
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:c7588c0d-2528-485d-b2df-04d6336428d7
:END:

Handling the flake.nix file used to be a bit of a chore, since it felt like writing so much boilerplate code just to define new systems. For a while, I used noweb-ref in order to alleviate this problem (see [[#h:dae0c5bb-edb7-4fe4-ae31-9f8f064cc53c][Appendix A: Noweb-Ref blocks]], an example of the repository at that time would be =acc0ad6: Add several NixOS hosts on Proxmox and Oracle Cloud=.). However, the true answer laid in making use of builtin nix functionality.

Nowadays, I use flake-parts to manage my flake. It allows me to conveniently split the actual flake into multiple files ("parts") using the following mechanism:

- =imports= are files pulled in to build the flake configuration (similar to the imports in the module system)
- =systems= defines the architectures that the flake should be provided for - I go here for the four "main" architectures, although true support is only provided for linux systems (see [[#h:6ed1a641-dba8-4e85-a62e-be93264df57a][Packages (pkgs)]] for the main reason)

** flake.nix skeleton
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:aee5ec75-7ca6-40d8-b6ac-a3e7e33a474b
:END:

In general, a nix flake consists of one or more inputs and several outputs. The inputs are used to define where nix should be looking for packages, modules, and more. The outputs generate expressions that can be used in .nix files as well as system configurations using these files.

In the start, I enable some public cache repositories. This saves some time during rebuilds because it avoids building as many packages from scratch - this is mainly important for community flakes like =emacs-overlay=, which basically would trigger a rebuild whenever updating the flake. The repository does of course not hold everything, but it lightens the pain. It would look cleaner if this were to be used only inside a nix configuration block of an actual system, but I want these caches to be used for e.g. app calls as well.

In many flakes, you see a structure like this: =outputs = inputs@ [...]=, the =inputs@= makes it so that all inputs are automatically passed to the outputs and can be called as =inputs.<name>=, whereas explicit arguments may just be called by using =<name>=. For most flakes this is fully sufficient, as they do not need to be called often and it saves me maintainance effort with this file. In fact, I also used to make use of this mechanism. However, using flake-parts, all I really need for the outputs function is inputs, which is why my outputs = inputs: inputs.flake-parts.lib.mkFlake { inherit inputs; } { [...] ). Note that flake-parts must inherit these inputs and no other arguments are expected.

In this section I am creating some attributes that define general concepts of my configuration:

- =nixosModules= imports self-defined options that I only want to use on NixOS systems. All modules are held as separately as possible, to allow for easier sharing with other people mostly.
- =homeModules= imports modules that are to be used on NixOS and non-NixOS systems. These are mostly used to define outputs (monitors), keyboards and special commands for machines.
- =packages= holds packages that I am building myself. These are mostly shell scripts, but also a few others such as AppImages and firefox addons.
- =devShells= provides a development shell that can be used as a bootstrap for new installs using =nix develop= while inside the flake directory. It received an overhaul in =0a6cf0e feat: add checks to devShell=, since when it is handled using =forAllSystems= and now including pre-commit-hook checks.
- =formatter= provides the formatter that is to be used on =.nix= files. It can be called by using =nix fmt=.
- =check= provides the pre-commit-hook checks that I have explained in [[#h:cbd5002c-e0fa-434a-951b-e05b179e4e3f][Pre-commit-hooks (Checks)]].
- =overlays= imports a few community overlays (such as the emacs-overlay) and also three overlays of my own:
  1) =additions= holds derivations that I am adding myself to nixpkgs - i.e. this is where the packages defined in =/pkgs= get added to nixpkgs.
  2) =modifications= holds derivations that I have performed overrides on. The list of interesting attribute overrides can be found by looking at the source code of a derivation and looking at the start of the file for lines of the form =<name> ? <val>=. But this can also be used to, for example, fetch a different version of a package instead.
  3) =nixpkgs-stable= holds the newest version of stable nixpkgs. I only use this on packages that seem broken on unstable, which are not many.
  4) =zjstatus= holds some options for =zellij=, but I have stopped using it since I prefer =tmux=.
  They are defined in [[#h:5e3e21e0-57af-4dad-b32f-6400af9b7aab][Overlays (additions, overrides, nixpkgs-stable)]]. The way this is handled was simplified in =647a2ae feat: simplify overlay structure=; however, the old structure might be easier to understand as a reference.

Here we define inputs and outputs of the flake. First, the following list is for the outputs of the flake.

Format: <name>,

Mind the comma at the end. You need this because the =...= is being passed as the last argument in the template at [[#h:aee5ec75-7ca6-40d8-b6ac-a3e7e33a474b][flake.nix template]].

Here, just add the input names, urls and other options that are needed, like =nixpkgs.follows=. By using the latter option, you tell the package to not provide it's own package repository, but instead 'nest' itself into another, which is very useful.
A short overview over each input and what it does:

- [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs][nixpkgs]]
  This is the base repository that I am following for all packages. I follow the unstable branch.
- [[https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager][home-manager]]
  This handles user-level configuration and mostly provides dotfiles that are generated and symlinked to =~/.config/=.
- [[https://github.com/Swarsel/.dotfiles][swarsel]]
  This pulls in the very dotfiles you are currently reading. I am adding this to the flake registry in order to have easier access to my customizations in nix calls, for example =nix-instantiate=
- [[https://github.com/nix-community/NUR][NUR]]
  The nix user repository contains user provided modules, packages and expressions. These are not audited by the nix community, so be aware of supply chain vulnerabilities when using those. I am only really using rycee's firefox addons from there which saves me a lot of hassle, and it seems to be a safe resource.
- [[https://github.com/nix-community/nixGL][nixGL]]
  This solves the problem that nix has with "OpenGL", as libraries are not linked and programs will often fail to find drivers. But I do not fully understand what it does. All I know is that I usually have to use this on non-NIxoS systems.
- [[https://github.com/danth/stylix][stylix]]
  As described before, this handles all theme related options.
- [[https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix][sops-nix]]
  This provides declarative secrets management for NixOS and home manager using sops and age keys. It is a bit more cumbersome to use on home manager systems - which is a bother because I then have to resort to that configuration to keep everything supported - but it is super practical and really the primary reason why it makes sense for me to go for NixOS, as I do not have to do any extra secrets provisioning.
- [[https://github.com/nix-community/lanzaboote][Lanzaboote]]
  Provides secure boot for NixOS. Needed for my Surface Pro 3.
- [[https://github.com/nix-community/nix-on-droid][nix-on-droid]]
  This brings nix to android in an app that is similar to tmux! Of course most of the configuration does not apply to this, but it is still neat to have!
- [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-hardware][nixos-hardware]]
  Provides specific hardware setting for some hardware configurations. For example, this sets some better defaults for my Lenovo Thinkpad P14s Gen2.
- [[https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-generators][nixos-generators]]
  Provides me with images that I can use to create LXCs on Proxmox.
- [[https://github.com/Swarsel/nswitch-rcm-nix][nswitch-rcm-nix]]
  Allows auto injection of payloads upon connecting a Nintendo Switch.
- [[https://github.com/nix-community/nix-index-database][nix-index-database]]
  This provides a database for =nix-index= that is updated weekly. This allows for declarative management, without needing to run the =nix-index= command for database assembly.
- [[https://github.com/nix-community/disko][disko]]
  disko provides declarative disk partitioning, which I use for impermanence as well as [[https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-anywhere][nixos-anywhere]].
- [[https://github.com/nix-community/impermanence][Impermanence]]
  Some of my machines are using a btrfs filesystem that wipes the root directory on each reboot. This forces me to pay more attention in keeping my system declarative as well as helping me keeping the system uncluttered. However, it is a chore to make sure that important files are not deleted. This flake helps with this problem, allowing me to select files and directories for persisting.
- [[https://github.com/dj95/zjstatus][zjstatus]]
  This provides utilities for customizing a statusbar in zellij. Currently unused as I prefer tmux for now and might be removed in the future.
- [[https://github.com/TamtamHero/fw-fanctrl][fw-fanctrl]]
  This provides access to the internal fans of Frameworks laptops. This is a bit more nice to use than directly using ectool.
- [[https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin][nix-darwin]]
  After learning that MacOS systems can also be configured using nix, I managed to get access to an old MacBook for testing. This allows to set most general settings that can otherwise be set using the Mac GUI.
- [[https://github.com/cachix/git-hooks.nix][pre-commit-hooks]]
  Provides access to several checks that can be hooked to be run before several stages in the process.
- [[https://github.com/oddlama/nix-topology][nix-topology]]
  This automatically creates a topology diagram of my configuration.
- flake-parts
  The aforementioned system that allows for more convenient flake crafting.
- devshell
  This provides devshell support for flake-parts

- a separate repo containing my secrets

  As for the second approach, I actually used this up to some point (see for example =7e11641: feat: add initial oauth2-proxy and freshrss oidc= as one of the lasts commits still using this system). However, it is quite bothersome to constantly have to keep two repositories up to date and in sync. Also, having a repo that every configuration relied upon that was also a private repo led to the problem that my demo configuration ([[#h:e1498bef-ec67-483d-bf02-76264e30be8e][Hotel (Demo Physical/VM)]]) would fail to build with that present, and I had to take several extra steps to make it buildable. Ever since deleting that dependency I also got rid of that problem. The whole system is inspired by [[https://oddlama.org/blog/evaluation-time-secrets-in-nix/][this blog article]] and large parts of it are adapted from [[https://github.com/oddlama/nix-config][oddlama's nix-config]].

The builtin that is added is a simple call to the =exec= function that calls a bash script. In order to keep some sanity, we are checking that we are actually calling it no an encryted nix file (even though there is no syntax check inside) and that the path given is a true nix path. Note that a string path will not be accepted, as that can have impurity implications.

This is the file that manages the actual decryption of the files mentioned in [[#h:87c7893e-e946-4fc0-8973-1ca27d15cf0e][extra-builtins]]. We simply fetch the appropriate system age key from the ssh host key and then call =sops decrypt=. Since it would be a bother to decrypt these files on every build, I keep the result cached and only re-decrypt if it changes. Keeping it cached outside the nix store incurrs a theoretical bit of impurity. However, this is easier to manage and also nothing really relies on these files being present.

** Library functions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:f9b7ffba-b7e2-4554-9a35-ece0bf173e1c
:END:

This section defines all functions of my own that I add to =lib=. These are used in all places over the config, however mainly in the files responsible for handling various imports.

A breakdown for the functions that have a non-obvious purpose:

- =pkgsFor=: This function reads all available systems from nixpkgs and generates pkgs for them. This is needed for my generation of home-manager and nix-on-droid systems in [[#h:5c5bf78a-9a66-436f-bd85-85871d9d402b][Hosts]].
  - uses [[#h:94690fcb-e039-49da-9bd3-610fa80fa08b][nixpkgs.lib.genAttrs]]
  - Also, in that function I am defining the =pkgs= that should be used when I reference =pkgs= in the actual configuration. I want to make sure that the correct system is used (keep in mind this is for home-manager configurations, which need that info! As a remark, you would not set this for a NixOS host), that I load my [[#h:7a059bd9-13f8-4005-b270-b41eeb6a4af2][Overlays]] (extra packages and modifications that I add to =pkgs=), as well as a setting that allows me to install unfree software. As a base package set I choose =nixpkgs= from my inputs (and so does nearly every configuration out there. Keep in mind however that you could use any package set here! =nixpkgs= however also comes with a lot of useful =lib= functions (that are not =builtins= to the nix language!))
- =mkTrueOption=: Defines a nixos module option that is by default enables (as opposed to =mkEnableOption= which are per default disabled).
- =mkStrong=:
  - An alias for ([[#h:9e81b727-1436-4228-82b1-1edec5c50e06][nixpkgs.lib.mkOverride]] 60), which is higher than setting an option normally (i.e. =option = value=; which has priority 100), but being of lower priority than using [[#h:16599d68-0ca5-40fa-810e-76b5c739b2b1][nixpkgs.lib.mkForce]], which has priority 50 (lower priority takes precedence). For completeness' sake, the priority set when using [[#h:41180e6c-2a13-4b46-89b2-791562b4b816][nixpkgs.lib.mkDefault]] is 1000 (a very low value).
- =forEachLinuxSystem=: performs the =pkgsFor= function for a set of =systems= (here: =x86_64-linux= and =aarch64-linux=). I need to use this in the [[#h:6ed1a641-dba8-4e85-a62e-be93264df57a][Packages (pkgs)]] section in order to avoid trying to build those packages for darwin systems.
  - uses [[#h:94690fcb-e039-49da-9bd3-610fa80fa08b][nixpkgs.lib.genAttrs]]
- =readHosts=: Reads the names of directories under the =hosts/= folder for a particular system type
  - uses [[#h:1fb6ff92-7cc1-4447-8a63-460f24633053][builtins.readDir]]
  - uses [[#h:0fded8e7-6160-4fcd-a491-42f0debfec52][nixpkgs.lib.attrNames]] to acquire attribute names from the outputs of =builtins.readDir=
- =readNix=: reads all files in a directory that are not =default.nix= (usually used to simply load everything from a folder and is called inside that respective =default.nix=).
  - uses [[#h:1fb6ff92-7cc1-4447-8a63-460f24633053][builtins.readDir]]
  - uses [[#h:0fded8e7-6160-4fcd-a491-42f0debfec52][nixpkgs.lib.attrNames]] to acquire attribute names from the outputs of =builtins.readDir=
- =mkImports=: These are used to help with importing files mostly:
  - uses [[#h:a4f9752a-33a6-4dd4-97ea-ef6bf340bd8e][nixpkgs.lib.map]] to actually import the list of modules that are passed to =mkImports= in names.

Concerning the =flake = _:= part:
  - this is a mechanism introduced by [[https://flake.parts/][flake-parts]]. A =flake= output is akin to a 'normal' output of a standard nix flake (meaning, it will not be built specifically for each system defined by =mkFlake=)
  - =lib= is then defined as the merged set of the =nixpkgs= and =home-manager= lib's, as well as some extra functions that I defined in the let-block (the =.extend()= method adds attributes to a set)

** Packages (pkgs)

:END:

This does not use =perSystem= from =flake-parts= since some of my custom packages are not able to be built on darwin systems, and I was not yet interested in writing logic for handling that. Instead I use =forEachLinuxSystem= as described in [[#h:f9b7ffba-b7e2-4554-9a35-ece0bf173e1c][Library functions]] in roder to only build this for linux hosts.

Other nix users can make use of these packages either by installing them directly in their config (using my flake as an input and then installing =<packages.<systems>.<name>=) or by making use of the overlay that I provide in  [[#h:7a059bd9-13f8-4005-b270-b41eeb6a4af2][Overlays]]. In the latter case all packages will be made available to the consuming flake

This file is used to parse each =nixosConfiguration= present in this flake and scan them for options set under the =globals= attribute set. I use =lib.evalModules= to evaluate a mini module system that only consists of these globals options and then load them into the actual configuration by providing a =globals= output to the flake. This treads a dangerous ground of infinite recursions, which is why both the module system as well as the inherited attributes are kept to the minimal size. Each module has a globals option loaded from a module file which will be separately loaded by this mini-evaluation.
  - uses [[#h:b9663237-2232-4554-bc81-843be28a707c][nixpkgs.lib.mapAttrsToList]] on =config.nodes=
  - uses [[#h:21389cc9-fd89-45ca-9836-592f84a45bb4][nixpkgs.lib.flip]] to reverse the function argument order of the =mapAttrsToList= call, so that we can give the attribute set (=config.nodes=) first. Alternatively, we could have written =lib.mapAttrsToList (name: cfg: [...]) config.nodes= but it would be harder to read since there would be a big block between the arguments.
  - uses [[#h:22264e49-b6d0-4c1f-8d05-2ef1f3da3d54][nixpkgs.lib.concatLists]]. =options.config._globalDefs= holds the =options.globals.definitions= for each node (which in turn basically holds the information that has been set for each node under the =globals= option), so the concatenated list will look something like  =[ { services.kanidm.domain = "foo"; }; } { services.freshrss.domain = "bar"; } ]=.
  - uses [[#h:82c26445-2af4-4a6c-ae91-c804325fdf11][nixpkgs.lib.mkMerge]] to merge these seperate attribute sets in the list into one big attribute set (the above attribute set example would become then ={ services = { kanidm.domain = "foo"; freshrss.domain = "bar"; }; }=. You can see how this can now be referenced as a "global" set.

I also have a file for global values that cannot be attributed to one =nixosConfiguration= alsone; the structure of this =globals.nix.enc= requires a toplevel =globals= - that means, =globals.nix.enc= has the structure ={ globals = [...] }=.

Lastly, in order make this actually available to my configurations, i use the =inherit (globalsSystem.config.globals) [...]= which produces the =globals= output which I will pass to the =specialArgs= of my =nixosConfigurations=, which is when I will be finally able to use these definitions in my config.

** Hosts
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:5c5bf78a-9a66-436f-bd85-85871d9d402b
:END:

Here I define my hosts. Earlier (in [[#h:aee5ec75-7ca6-40d8-b6ac-a3e7e33a474b][flake.nix skeleton]]), I told you how I used to use noweb-ref blocks to achieve this task. You see, a single =nixosConfiguration= uses =nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem=, passing modules and arguments to define itself. I have automated this process by reading all directories in the =hosts/= directory and then applying =nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem= as a function on these returns. I also provide a =nixosConfigurationsMinimal= output which is ingested by the flake in =install/flake.nix= to be used during the initial deployment of a new system (it basically just disables most modules).

- =mkNixosHost=: Very much akin to a simple call of =nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem=, I simply define =specialArgs= and =modules= that I want to use for every configuration. Here, I load all the extra modules from my other input flakes. Also, I add the =globals= output from [[#h:af83893d-c0f9-4b45-b816-4849110d41b3][Globals]] and the =nodes= output that I define right here (it simply mirrors all "full" configurations - nixOS and darwin. I like to refer to home-manager only and nix-on-droid as a "half" configurations). It is also here that I set the node name for the configuration (I prefer this explicit call over referencing =networking.hostName= or such) and the directory that should be used for secrets of a configuration.
- =mkDarwinHost= works in the same way but for darwin machines.

- =mkHalfHost= is a function that either creates a pure home-manager configuration or a nix-on-droid one. The type must be explicitly passed when calling the function. Here, again, we make use of =pkgsFor= that we defined in [[#h:f9b7ffba-b7e2-4554-9a35-ece0bf173e1c][Library functions]]. Also, we make sure to pass =extraSpecialArgs= (the pendant to =specialArgs=, just for home-manager configurations).

- =diskoConfigurations=: specifies a default disko configuration that is to be used if someone pulls in my flake as a disko configuration. This is not used by me, but I think it is kind of neat.

- =nodes=: As stated above, a shorthand for my configurations. Is built using the [[#h:b1fe7a9a-661b-4446-aefa-98373108f8fd][The '//' operator]]

The rest of the outputs either define or help define the actual configurations:
  - =mkHalfHostConfigs= works by calling the =nixpkgs.lib.foldl= function to build an attribute set of home-manager/nix-on-droidd configurations
    - uses [[#h:e21d17fb-0c98-42d5-b08f-1c7584afa07f][nixpkgs.lib.foldl]]  on the list created by [[#h:a4f9752a-33a6-4dd4-97ea-ef6bf340bd8e][nixpkgs.lib.map]] over =mkHalfHost=. In each step of the fold, I receive an attribute set. This attribute set is then merged to the resulting set using the =(acc: set: acc // set)= expression
    - uses [[#h:b1fe7a9a-661b-4446-aefa-98373108f8fd][The '//' operator]] to merge the sets of the fold operation.

** Topology
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:391e7712-fef3-4f13-a3ed-d36e228166fd
:END:

This defines some topology for the [[https://github.com/oddlama/nix-topology][nix-topology]] modole that can not otherwise be parsed from the config (or is global). For example, this is used to define a number of switches, printers and routers. The topology graph is built from left to right, meaning that =nodes.internet = mkInternet { connections = [ (mkConnection "moonside" "wan") ]; };= means that the node =internet= 'initiates' the connection to the node =moonside= (=internet= will be on the left).

Another note concerning [[https://flake.parts/][flake-parts]]:
  - =perSystem= is a mechanism that tells flake-parts to build the following attribute set for all systems. This replaces the need to handle myself any =system= or =pkgs= variables, this is done by flake-parts.

** Devshell (checks)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:4d0548db-99b2-4e07-b762-6d86fbb26d4c
:END:

This file defines a number of checks that can either be run by calling =nix flake check= or while in a =nix-shell= or =nix develop=. This helps me make sure that my flake confirms to my self-imposed standards. The GitHub actions perform less checks than are being done here (they are only checking the formatting, as well as =statix= and =deadnix=).

The devshell also provides a number of useful shorthand commands, as well as a 'safe' version of nixpkgs that I can use to rebuild from in case a version bump in nixpkgs suddenly breaks [[https://github.com/shlevy/nix-plugins][nix-plugins]].

Lastly, in the =perSystem= attribute set, we see that it is actually passed some values here. These expose to the scoped expressions the enclosed values, which makes it possible to still reference e.g. =system= and =pkgs= even when they are actually handled by flake-parts.

** Templates

This file defines the templates that are being exposed by the flake. These can be used by running =nix flake init -t github:Swarsel/.dotfiles#<TEMPLATE_NAME>= by others. Personally, I mostly use these as part of the [[#h:154b6df4-dd50-4f60-9794-05a140d02994][project]] utility.

Otherwise, I define the function =mkTemplates= here which builds a named attribute set for each type of template that I have.

** TODO Modules
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:e8eb0617-3441-421d-9b44-716ed40159ab
:END:

This exposes all of my modular configuration as modules. Other people can use them in their flake using =imports = [ inputs.<name>.nixosModules ];=. Per default, this enables some mechanisms like config sharing between nodes and the globals system. TODO: make it so that nothing is enabled upon initial import.

=nixosModules= is a `defined` flake output, where external tools might expect some sort of structure; hence, I call the default output =default=, which will, in many cases, allow the user to just reference to the flake itself (which will then use =nixosModules.default= automatically.

=homeModules= on the other hand is not standardized in this way (for example, many flakes refere to =homeManagerModules= instead); in order not to unnecessarily break things, I leave it as is.

  { self, ... }:

** Apps
:PROPERTIES:

:END:

This defines some apps; they differ from normal packages in that they can be called using =nix run <repo><appName>=. So, for example, I can call my deployment script using =nix run --experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' github:Swarsel/.dotfiles -- -n <CONFIGURATION_NAME> -d <TARGET_IP>= (here I did not specify =#swarsel-bootstrap= since it is set as the default. In general, whenever the =#...= part is ommitted, the object under the default attribute will be used. This is also true for =nixosConfigurations=: in that case, the default will be the current hostname of the machine).

- uses [[#h:c63cd469-7724-4a05-b932-8843722a00f0][builtins.listToAttrs]]
- uses [[#h:b1fe7a9a-661b-4446-aefa-98373108f8fd][The '//' operator]] to add the default output to thte set of built apps.

** Overlays
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:7a059bd9-13f8-4005-b270-b41eeb6a4af2
:END:

In this section I define packages that I manually add to nixpkgs, or that I want to use in a modified way. This can be useful for packages that are currently awaiting a PR or public packages that I do not want to maintain.

As such, I also define three additional overlays:

1) =additions=
   These are for the aforementioned added packages.
   NOTE: The packages themselves are built in [[#h:6ed1a641-dba8-4e85-a62e-be93264df57a][Packages (pkgs)]]; here, we just add them to the overlay that we then use in the configuration.
2) =modification=
   These are for packages that are on nixpkgs, but do not fit my usecase, meaning I need to perform modifications on them.
3) =nixpkgs-stable-versions=
   These are simply mirrors of other branches of nixpkgs (mostly past stable branches). Useful for packages that are broken on nixpkgs, but do not need to be on bleeding edge anyways. Automatically fetches all inputs names =nixpkgs-<suffix>= and adds them under the name in =<suffix>=.

Also, this is where I define all of my own modules. These are mostly used for setting some host-specifics directly than opposed to through multiple options.

Lastly, I add some of my own library functions to be used alongside the functions provided by =nixpkgs= and =home-manager=.

On the structure of overlays: as you notice, all of the attributes within overlays are functions which take =final= and =prev= as arguments. This is a convention (sometimes you also see =super= instead of =final=) that aims to tell you that =final= represents the =pkgs= set after it has gone over all modifications, while =prev= is the =pkgs= set before the current modification.
  - So, in =additions=, the =final= set is the same as in =modifications=, but their =prev= sets might differ (in this case, I believe they will be the same since all modifications are done at the same step). #TODO: fact check
  - This starts to make a difference when you use multiple overlays and have one overlay depend on the modifications in another overlay.

- The =_= argument is used like in a number of other programing languages and signals that the argument is never actually used in the function.

:CUSTOM_ID: h:1d1ccae5-62ca-4d37-a28e-c59987850ed2
:END:

This sections makes use of [[https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-generators][nixos-generators]] in order to easily allow me to build a live ISO of my installer system. It can be built using =nix build --print-out-paths --no-link <flake path>#images.<target-system>.live-iso=, and can then be copied to a USB drive using, for example, =dd=.

This is an improvement to what I did earlier, where I did not use =nixos-generators= but instead manually imported the needed modules to make this configration into a bootable USB image. Now, I can just write this in the same way that I would to write any other configuration.

- =perSystem= is again a =flake-parts= construct.

          inherit pkgs;
          specialArgs = { inherit self; };

** Installer flake
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:1d4514b4-e952-4faf-b30e-d89e73a526c6
:END:

When using tools like (the builtin) =nixos-rebuild= or =nixos-anywhere=, these tools expect the flake to have a certain structure; namely, they expect to find an output named =nixosConfigurations=, which is implicitely used when passing =--flake .#<config name>= (it is used in front of =<config name>=).

When I define my configurations, I am actually defining two versions for each actual system:
  - One 'regular' config that should be used by all rebuild tools such as =nixos-rebuild=
  - One 'minimal' config that should be used by =nixos=anywhere= during initial deployment of a system

Now, I could of course define a =<name>= and =<name>-minimal= attribute for each configuration and just put these under =nixosConfigurations=, but that would have several drawbacks:
  - evaluation time would increase
  - my =nodes= output (that holds information for all actual systems) would bloat
  - it is actually not clear that =<name>= and =<name>-minimal= represent the same config

Hence, what I instead do is to define another output =nixosConfigurationsMinimal= as an output to this flakes' config, and then use it to set the =nixosConfigurations= of another, minimal, flake that I keep in =install/=. When using =nixos-anywhere= during initial deployment, I will then point it to that minimal flake, where the minimal configs can be found.

    description = "Minimal installer flake - not to be used manually";

* System

** System specific configuration
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:88bf4b90-e94b-46fb-aaf1-a381a512860d
:END:

This section mainly exists to house different =default.nix= files to define some modules that should be loaded on respective systems.
Every host is housed in the =hosts/= directory, which is then subdivided by each respective system (=nixos/=, =home-manager/=, =nix-on-droid/=, =darwin/=). As described earlier, some of these configurations (nixos and darwin) can be defined automatically in this flake. For home-manager and nix-on-droid, the system architecture must be defined manually.

*** TODO Template
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:373bd9e8-616e-434e-bfab-c216ce4470e9
:END:

This is the template that I use for new deployments of personal machines. Servers are usually highly tailored to their specific task and I do not consider it worth a time to craft a template for that. Also, at least at the current time, I only provide a template for NixOS hosts, as I rarely ever use anything else.

TODO: I dont think this template would currently work out of the box

My server setup was originally built on Proxmox VE; back when I started, I created all kinds of wild Debian/Ubuntu/etc. KVMs and LXCs on there. However, the root disk has suffered a weird failure where it has become unable to be cloned, but was still functional. I was for a long time rewriting all machines on there to use NixOS instead; this process is now finished.

I have removed most of the machines from this section. What remains are some hosts that I have deployed on OCI:
  - =MilkyWell=: cloud server used for very lightweight sync tasks of non-critical data
  - =Moonside=: Proxy server + some lightweight services

**** TODO Drugstore (ISO installer config)
:PROPERTIES:

:END:

This is a live environment ISO that I use to bootstrap new systems. It only loads a minimal configuration and no graphical interface. After booting this image on a host, find out its IP and bootstrap the system using the =bootstrap= utility.

NOTE: Yes, the path to this system does not follow the scheme outlined above - I still consider this a 'config' however, so I keep it here.

TODO: cleanup this mess

This is just a demo host. It applies all the configuration found in the common parts of the flake, but disables all secrets-related features (as they would not work without the proper SSH keys).

I also set the =WLR_RENDERER_ALLOW_SOFTWARE=1= to allow this configuration to run in a virtualized environment. I also enable =qemuGuest= for a smoother experience when testing on QEMU.

We disable the warnings that trigger when rebuilding with a dirty flake. At this point, I am also disabling channels and pinning the flake registry - the latter lets me use the local version of nixpkgs for commands like =nix shell= (without it, we will always download the newest version of nixpkgs for these commands).

Also, the system state version is set here. No need to touch it.

A breakdown of the flags being set:
- =nixpgks.config.allowUnfree=: allows packages with an unfree license to be built
- nix.settings:
  - experimental-features:
    - nix-command: Enables the =nix= command from nix 2.4
    - flakes: Enables flakes to be used
    - ca-derivations: Enables content-addressed derivations, which stops unnecessary rebuiluds - to be used with my TODO private hydra and the binary cache =cache.ngi0.nixos.org= in [[#h:aee5ec75-7ca6-40d8-b6ac-a3e7e33a474b][flake.nix template]]
    - cgroups: allows the use of cgroups in builds
    - pipe-operators: Enables 'piping' instead of the classic currying syntax - =fun arg= can be expressed as =arg |> fun=. Associatively, it is weaker than functions: =a |> b |> d c |> e = e ((d c) (b a))=
  - trusted-users: these users have elevated privileges in nix (mostly used to acknowledge binary caches) - root is added per default here
  - connect-timeout: normally, nix tries to reach the cache for 300 seconds for each derivation per cache. This setting lets me change that
  - bash-prompt-prefix: adds a prefix to shells spawned by =nix develop=
  - [min,max]-free: amounts of space where intermittent GC will be run during builds
  - flake registry: URI of the global flake registry (I disable it)
  - auto-optimise-store: create hardlinks in the nix store to save space
  - warn-dirty: I do not need to see the warning when I have uncommited changes
  - max-jobs: How many build jobs should be run in parallel. =auto= sets this to the number of CPUs (which is all) - on systems with many cores this can lead to OOM situations. The default is now =1=, but used to be =auto=, I set this manually just to be safe in the future.
  - use-cgroups: Actually run builds within cgroups
- nix.channel.enable: whether to use channels
- nix.registry: Sets the registry for this flake, which I set to its inputs. This allows me to use e.g. =nixpkgs= directly in =nix repl=
- nix.nixPath: Basically the same as =nix.registry=, but for the legacy nix commands

            Anything that you wouldn't want people to see on GitHub, but that can live unencrypted
            on your own devices. Consider it a more ergonomic nix alternative to using git-crypt.

            All of these secrets may (and probably will be) put into the world-readable nix-store

:PROPERTIES:

:END:

This takes care of the main Yubikey related configuration on the NixOS side - note that the starting of the gpg-agent is done in the sway settings, to also perform this step of the setup for non NixOS-machines at the same time.

I want to use the ssh-agent from gpg-agent's ssh compatibility, which is why we disable ssh-agent. Also, we load some extra udev rules using =hardware.gpgSmartcards.enable=.

Many guides state that it is needed to enable =pcscd=  to use the smartcard mode (CCID) of the Yubikey. However, enabling it causes some problems when locking the screen and unplugging the Yubikey, after which the Yubikey only becomes available again as a smart card after about one minute. I found that is is sufficient to enable =services.gpg-agent.enableScDaemon= in home-manager instead.

Also, since I use a GPG key in sops, it seems that scdaemon creates an instance at boot which sometimes hogs the Yubikey, which leads to significant delays after e.g. locking the screen and unplugging the Yubikey. Since I do not need the GPG key for the actual sops secrets (I use machine age keys instead), I kill that process.

This provides libraries for binaries that are not patched for use on NixOS. This really makes the biggest gripe with NixOS go away, that being having to run a binary that is only found in a single spot. It is most of the times possible to patch such a file, but this makes such a situation take much less time to resolve.

Only some binaries that touch system settings might still not work, apart from that, the list of libraries I have curated here should be quite exhaustive.

When a program does not work, start with =nix-ldd <program>=. This will tell you which library is missing. Afterwards, continue with =nix-locate <program>= to find which packages provide that library. Add it to libraries below and rebuild. After a reboot, it will be visible using =nix-ldd=. It can also be useful to take a look at =ldd= to see which libraries are needed in general.

*** Server
:PROPERTIES:

In a similar way as the [[#h:1bb03c4c-7749-47c1-9af6-1b3d748cebf4][Client]] section, these modules are to be used mostly on servers.

First, we enable the use of =home-manager= as a NixoS module.

Also, we disable the warnings that trigger when rebuilding with a dirty flake. At this point, I am also disabling channels and pinning the flake registry - the latter lets me use the local version of nixpkgs for commands like =nix shell= (without it, we will always download the newest version of nixpkgs for these commands).

Also, the system state version is set here. No need to touch it.

Here we just define some aliases for rebuilding the system, and we allow some insecure packages that are needed by some server derivations. It would be more elegant to define these in the respective module, but nixpkgs needs to be defined before we can evaluate modules within it, so this must be a top-level configuration.

**** Disk encryption

The hostkey can be generated with =ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -f /etc/secrets/initrd/ssh_host_ed25519_key=.
Use =lspci -v | grep -iA8 'network\|ethernet'= to supposedly find out which kernel module is needed for networking in initrd. However I prefer a different approach:

Use =lspci -nn | grep -i network= to find out manufacturer info:

#+begin_src shell :exports both
lspci -nn | grep -i 'network\|ethernet'

#+RESULTS:
: 04:00.0 Network controller [0280]: MEDIATEK Corp. MT7922 802.11ax PCI Express Wireless Network Adapter [14c3:0616]

From the last bracket, then take the first value to find out the correct kernel module:

:END:

FreshRSS is a more 'classical' RSS aggregator that I can just host as a distinct service. This also has its upsides because I jave more control over the state this way.

It serves both a Greader API at https://${serviceName}/api/greader.php, as well as a Fever API at     https://${serviceName}/api/fever.php.

I am using this with CapyReader on my phone, set it up as a FreshRSS account with Server URL =https://${serviceName}/api/greader.php

FreshRSS claims to support HTTP header auth, but at least it does not work with my oauth2-proxy setup. Until this is fixed, I resorted to the "form" login, since I mostly do not use the web version anyways.

The forgejo configuration is a little broken and will show a 500 error when signing in through kanidm. However, when pressing back and refreshing the page, I am logged in. Currently I cannot be bothered to fix this.

A stupid (but simple) way to get the =originUrl= is to simply set any URL there and try to auth using kanidm. Then check the logs (=journalctl -eu kanidm=) and check for the line that says something along the lines of
  `🚧 [warn]: Invalid OAuth2 redirect_uri (must be an exact match to a redirect-url) - got <your =originURL=>`

To get other URLs (token, etc.), use https://<kanidmDomain>/oauth2/openid/<clientID>/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server, e.g. https://<kanidmDomain>/oauth2/openid/nextcloud/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server, with clienID being the client name as specified in kanidm.

:END:

These sets of configuration do not need to be deployed on every host, for a multitude of reasons.

- The gaming set is not needed on weak machines, and also not on my work machine.
- The VirtualBox package takes forever to build, and I do not need virtual machines on every host.
- There are some hosts that I do not want to autologin to.
- =nswitch-rcm= is a tool I wrote for easy payload flashing of a Nintendo Switch in RCM mode. However, that is not needed on every machine.
- The work profile is only used on my work laptop.

TODO: evaluate whether I should keep using this structure.

*** Steps to setup/upgrade home-manager only
Steps to get a home-manager only setup up and running:

#+begin_src markdown :noweb-ref homemanageronlysetup :exports both :results html
  - (Optional) Install openssh-server
  - Set hostname to the name specified in the home-manager configuration
  - Install nix, either:
    - (if upgrading existing nix) Install nix version matching with version that `nix-plugins` is compiled against: `nix-env --install --file '<nixpkgs>' cacert -I nixpkgs=channel:nixpkgs-unstable --attr nixVersions.nix_x_yy`
    - (or installing nix freshly):
      - Grab the link to the install script of the needed nix version from https://releases.nixos.org/?prefix=nix, e.g. https://releases.nixos.org/nix/nix-2.30.1/install
      - `bash <(curl -L https://releases.nixos.org/nix/nix-x-yy-y/install) --daemon`
  - add the following to /etc/nix/nix.conf to become a trusted user: `trusted-users = @wheel root swarsel`
  - For the first build:
    1) Clone dotfile repo & change into it
    2) `nix --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' develop`
    3) `home-manager --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' switch --flake .#$(hostname) --show-trace`

to get the info for the secondary gpu, use `lspci -nn | grep VGA`
It can be set to either:
  - a number, selecting the n-th non-default GPU
  - a PCI bus id in the form =pci-XXX_YY_ZZ_U=

I use sops-nix to handle secrets that I want to have available on my machines at all times. Procedure to add a new machine:
- `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "NAME sops"` in .ssh directory (or wherever) - name e.g. "sops"
- cat ~/.ssh/sops.pub | ssh-to-age | wl-copy
- add the output to .sops.yaml
- cp ~/.ssh/sops.pub ~/.dotfiles/secrets/keys/NAME.pub
- update entry for sops.age.sshKeyPaths

  Since we are using the home-manager implementation here, we need to specify the runtime path.

nix-index provides a way to find out which packages are provided by which derivations. By default it also comes with a replacement for =command-not-found.sh=, however, the implementation is based on a channel based setup. I like consistency, so I replace the command with one that provides a flakes-based output.

zsh is the most convenient shell for me and it happens to be super neat to configure within home manager.

Here we set some aliases (some of them should be shellApplications instead) as well as some zsh plugins like =fzf-tab=.
Concerning the shell extensions, =zle <widget-name>= will run an existing widget and =zle -N <function_name>= will make a function available for use. The =my-= functions all remove =.= =/= and =:= from the =WORDCHARS= so that functions will stop there. The keycodes can be found using =showkeys -a=

Regarding =initContent=:
To specify the order, use lib.mkOrder.

Common order values:
- 500 (mkBefore: Early initialization (replaces initExtraFirst
- 550: Before completion initialization (replaces initExtraBeforeCompInit
- 1000 (default: General configuration (replaces initExtra
- 1500 (mkAfter: Last to run configuration

To specify both content in Early initialization and General configuration, use lib.mkMerge:

#+begin_src nix
initContent = let
zshConfigEarlyInit = lib.mkOrder 500 "do something";
zshConfig = lib.mkOrder 1000 "do something";
in
lib.mkMerge [ zshConfigEarlyInit zshConfig ];

Currently I only use it as before with =initExtra= though.

**** Home-manager: Emacs
:PROPERTIES:

:END:

By using the emacs-overlay NixOS module, I can install all Emacs packages that I want to use right through NixOS. This is done by passing my =init.el= file to the configuration which will then be parsed upon system rebuild, looking for =use-package= sections in the Elisp code. Also I define here the style of Emacs that I want to run - I am going with native Wayland Emacs here (=emacs-pgtk=). All of the nice options such as =tree-sitter= support are enabled by default, so I do not need to adjust the build process.

Lastly, I am defining some more packages here that the parser has problems finding. Also there are some packages that are not in ELPA or MELPA that I still want to use, like =calfw= and =fast-scroll=, so I build them here.

**** Waybar
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:0bf51f63-01c0-4053-a591-7f0c5697c690
:END:

Again I am just using the first bar option here that I was able to find good understandable documentation for. Of note is that the `cpu` section's `format` is not defined here, but in section 1 (since not every machine has the same number of cores)

This section is mostly used to deliver the correct information to Waybar. AMD systems have changing hwmon paths that can be specifically set here. Also the cpu count can be set here for Waybars cpu module, but 8 is usually a good setting to show

These are explicit waybar options. Laptops do not need the battery module. However, this leads to a slight problem with theming: my waybar modules alternate their background-color between black and grey. The battery module is usually on grey background. If I were to simply delete that, I would now have two modules on black background. To avoid this, I define a pseudo-module =custom/pseudobat= that simply shows a static image and calls =wlogout= on right click. This wastes a little bit of screen space, but that is a price I am willing to pay for consistency.

The rest of the related configuration is found here:
- [[#h:a9530c81-1976-442b-b597-0b4bed6baf25][Waybar]]
- [[#h:f93f66f9-6b8b-478e-b139-b2f382c1f25e][waybarupdate]]

**** Firefox
:PROPERTIES:

:END:

Setting up firefox along with some policies that are important to me (mostly disabling telemetry related stuff as well as Pocket). I also enable some integrations that enable super useful packages, namely =tridactyl= and =browserpass=.

Also, using NUR with rycee's firefox addons, it is very convenient for me to add firefox addons here that will be automatically installed.

Also, I setup some search aliases for functions I often use, such as NixOS options search (=@no=)

I used to build the firefox addon =bypass-paywalls-clean= myself here, but the maintainer always deletes old packages, and it became a chore for me to maintain here, so I no longer do that.

**** Sway

:END:

Currently, I am too lazy to explain every option here, but most of it is very self-explaining in any case.

As for the `home.sessionVariables`, it should be noted that environment variables that are needed at system start should NOT be loaded here, but instead in `programs.zsh.config.extraSessionCommands` (in the home-manager programs section). This is also where all the wayland related variables are stored.

*** Variables (vars; holds firefox & stylix config parts)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:ea362c55-97b4-45fd-bf41-ab461c444212
:END:

At work I am using several services that are using SSO login - however, as I am using four different accounts at work, this becomes a chore here. Hence, I have defined multiple profiles in [[#h:f0b2ea93-94c8-48d8-8d47-6fe58f58e0e6][Work]] that are all practically using the same configuration. To save screen space, I template that profile here.
Set in firefox =about:config > toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets= to true. This should in principle be set automatically using the below config, but it seems not to be working reliably.

For styling, I am using the [[https://github.com/danth/stylix][stylix]] NixOS module, loaded by flake. This package is really great, as it adds nix expressions for basically everything. Ever since switching to this, I did not have to play around with theming anywhere else.

The full list of nerd-fonts can be found here: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/nixos-unstable/pkgs/data/fonts/nerd-fonts/manifests/fonts.json

This is where the theme for the whole OS is defined. Originally, this noweb-ref section could not be copied to the general NixOS config since they are on different folder structure levels in the config, which would have made the flake impure. By now, I have found out that using the =${self}= method for referencing the flake root, I could circumvent this problem. Also, the noweb-ref block could in general be replaced by a custom attribute set (see for example [[#h:e7f98ad8-74a6-4860-a368-cce154285ff0][firefox]]). The difference here was, for a long time, that this block is used in a NixOS and a home-manager-only configuration, verbatim. If I were to use an attribute set, I would have to duplicate this block once each for NixOS and home-manager. Alas, this block stays (for now). However, I learned how to use an attribute set in a custom home-manager module and pass it to both NixOS and home-manager configurations, which also removed the need for that use of it.

In short, the options defined here are passed to the modules systems using =_modules.args= - they can then be used by passing =vars= as an attribute in the input attribute set of a modules system file (=basically all files in this configuration)

This is the central station for self-defined packages. These are all referenced in =default.nix=. Wherever possible, I am keeping the shell version of these scripts in this file as well and then read it using =builtin.readFile= in the NixOS configurations. This lets me keep full control in this one file but also keep the separate files uncluttered.

Note: The structure of generating the packages was changed in commit =2cf03a3 refactor: package and module generation=. That commit can be checked out in order to see a simpler version of achieving the same thing.

In this section I define custom modules under the =swarsel= attribute. These are mostly used to define settings specific to a host. I keep these settings confined to either home-manager or nixos to maintain compatibility with non-NixOS machines.

Note: The structure of generating the packages was changed in commit =2cf03a3 refactor: package and module generation=. That commit can be checked out in order to see a simpler version of achieving the same thing.

Modules that need to be loaded on the NixOS level. Note that these will not be available on systems that are not running NixOS.

In this section I handle my early init file; it takes care of frame-setup for emacsclient buffers.

*** Increase startup performance
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:38e03b65-9dfc-4547-b27d-236664d7dc15
:END:

First, I use some advice from doomemacs regarding garbace collection; here I make sure that during startup, the garbace collectur will not run, which will improve startup times. Now, that might not really be needed since I will usually only start the emacs server once during startup and then not touch it again, however, since I am building my emacs configuration using NixOS, there is some merit to this since I will usually need to restart the server once I rebuild my configuration.

Also, inspired by a setting I have seen in protesilaos' configuration, I apply the same idea to the =file-name-handler-alist= and =vc-handled-backends=.

In the end, we need to restore those values to values that will work during normal operation. For that, I add a hook to the startup function that will revert the values once Emacs has finished initialization.

Also packed into the hook function is the line =(fset 'epg-wait-for-status 'ignore)=. This line is needed at the end of the configuration in order to allow for my Yubikey to be used to encrypt and decrypt =.gpg= files. Without it, Emacs will just hang forever and basically crash.

Next, I will setup the basic frame for my emacs buffers. Note that I use a tiling window manager, so I do not need to hold myself up with sizing the windows myself. I also disable some GUI tools that I (like many others) do not find to be particularly useful. Also I inhibit many startup functions here, even though it does not affect me greatly since I use another solution for that.

We also make require immediate compilation of native code.

For the =default-frame-alist=, I used to also set ='(right-divider-width . 4)= and ='(bottom-divider-width . 4)=, but I did not like the look of the divider bar and usually know my splits anyways, so this is no longer set.

When programming, I like to be able to duplicate a line. There are easier functions than the one below, but they either

1) screw with undo/redo
2) move the cursor wildly

The below function avoids these problems. Originally I used the function =duplicate-line= found here: [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/88399/how-do-i-duplicate-a-whole-line-in-emacs]]

However, this function does not work on regions. Later, I found a solution implemented by [[https://github.com/bbatsov/crux][crux]]. I do not need the whole package, so I just extracted the three functions I needed from it.

**** Inhibit Messages in Echo Area
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:285e5c0a-875d-46a8-bb9b-0222b3d73878
:END:

Emacs likes to send messages to the echo area; this is generally a good thing. However, it bothers me a lot when I am currently working in minibuffer where I receive an echo area message that is actually important and it is then overwritten by e.g. the mu4e update message. This section makes it possible to find the root function calling the message function and disabling it here.

Usage: Enable the =(advice-add 'message :around #'who-called-me?)= by running this code block, which will show a full trace of all messages being sent to the echo area:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :export both :results silent

  (advice-add 'message :around #'who-called-me?)

#+end_src

Once the root function has been found, it can be disabled via =advice=add= as in the last block in this section. To disable the stack tracing, run =(advice-remove 'message #'who-called-me?)= or the following code block:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :results silent

  (advice-remove 'message #'who-called-me?)

#+end_src

Lastly, individual messages can be reenabled using the =(advice-remove '<FUNCTION-NAME> #'suppress-messages)= approach. Use this when you accidentally disabled a helpful message.

This section handles everything that shoudld happen when I save =SwarselSystems.org=. It:

1) automatically tangles all configuration blocks in this file
2) exports the configuration file as html for an easier reading experience with working links and index
3) formats the generated =.nix= files in accordance to the =Alejandra=-style.

We set a hook that runs everytime we save the file. It would be a bit more efficient to only export and format when we enter a magit window for instance (since especially the html export takes times), however, since I cannot be sure to only ever commit from magit (I do indeed sometimes use git from the command line), I prefer this approach.

This defines a set of keybinds that I want to have available globally. I have one set of keys that is globally available through the =C-SPC= prefix.

I also define some keybinds to some combinations directly. Those are used mostly for custom functions that I call often enough to warrant this.

In this section I move the =custom.el= out of it's standard location in =.emacs.d=. Firstly, I dislike using this file at all since I would rather have fully stateful configuration as commanded by this file. Secondly, this file is too easily permanently changed. Recently I figured out the last bits that I needed to remove from custom.el to no longer be reliant on it, so I now just write it to a temporary file (through =make-temp=file=) which will be cleaned on shutdown. However, I like to retain the custom framework because it is nice for testing out theme customizations, hence why I still load the file.

This section also sets the emacs directory to the =~/.cache/= directory which is useful for files that I do not want to have lying around in my =.emacs.d=.

Many people dislike the Emacs backup files; I do enjoy them, but have to admit that they clutter the filesystem a little too much. Also, I rarely need to access these over different sessions. Hence I move them to =/tmp= - if Emacs unexpectedly crashes, the files can be recovered, but the backup files will not gather everywhere and will be deleted upon shutdown.

- Firstly we disable to having to type `yes` and `no` and switch it to `y` and `n`.
- We also enable the marking of trailing whitespaces.
- Also, make emacs highlight the current line globally
- Emacs defaults to pausing all display redrawing on any input. This may have been useful previously, but is not necessary nowadays.
- I also disable the suspend-frame function, as I never use it and it is quite confusing when accidentally hitting the keys for it.

*** Indentation
:PROPERTIES:

:END:

Here I define several options related to indentation; I first make it so that only whitespace will be used instead of tab characters for indentation, and I also set a small standard indent.

We set =tab-always-indent= to ='complete= in order to indent first and then do completion if there are any. Also we make it so that python will not complain about missing indentation info.

Lastly, I load the =highlight-indent-guides= package. This adds a neat visual indicator of the indentation level, which is useful for languages like python.

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:b190d512-bfb5-42ec-adec-8d86bab726ce

This set of packages uses the default emacs completion framework and works together to provide a very nice user experience:

- Vertico simply provides a vertically stacking completion
- Marginalia adds more information to completion results
- Orderless allows for fuzzy matching
- Consult provides better implementations for several user functions, e.g. =consult-line= or =consult-outline=
- Embark allows acting on the results in the minibuffer while the completion is still ongoing - this is extremely useful since it allows to, for example, read the documentation for several functions without closing the help search. It can also collect the results of a grep operation into a seperate buffer that edits the result in their original location.

**** Helpful + which-key: Better help defaults
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:cbf6bd48-2503-489a-89da-e3359564e989
:END:

This pair of packages provides information on keybinds in addition to function names, which makes it easier to remember keybinds (=which-key=). The =helpful= package provides a better =Help= framework for Emacs. For some reason, the Help windows are always being focused by the cursor even though I have set =help-window-select= to nil. I do not understand why.

*** Ligatures

*** Popup (popper) + Shackle Buffers
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:e9d40e63-0e1f-47df-98f7-5427992588a4
:END:

The popper package allows to declare different buffers as 'popup-type', which sort of acts like a scratchpad. It can be toggled at any time using =popper-toggle= and the resulting frame can be freely customized (with =shackle=) to a certain size. It is also possible to prevent a buffer from appearing - I do this for example to the =*Warnings*= buffer, since usually I am not interested in it's output.

=popper-echo-mode= shows all buffers that are currently stored as a popup in the echo area when a popup is opened - this is useful since you can cycle between all popup buffers.

** Modules

This section houses all configuration bits that are related to a specific package that is not fundamental to my Emacs experience.

At some point this will receive further sorting, but for now this is good enough.

*** Org Mode
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:99544398-72af-4382-b8e1-01b2221baff4
:END:

org-mode is probably my most-used mode in Emcas. It acts as my organizer, config management tool and calender even.

Note that nearly all headings within the =Org-mode= heading are coded within the =use-package= setup, so be very careful about moving stuff about here.

**** General org-mode
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:877c9401-a354-4e44-a235-db1a90d19e00

This sets up the basic org-mode. I wrote a function to handle some of the initial org-mode behaviour in [[#h:06b77d28-3fd5-4554-8c7d-32c1b0ec8da5][org-mode setup.

This part of the configuration mostly makes some aesthetic changes, enables neat LaTeX and points Emacs to some files that it needs for org-mode

It also offers a very useful utility of exporting org-mode buffers to different formats; the feature I enjoy most is what makes this file useful: the tangling functionality.

Tree-sitter is a parsing library integrated into Emacs to provide better syntax highlighting and code analysis. It generates concrete syntax trees for source code, enabling more accurate and efficient text processing. Emacs' tree-sitter integration enhances language support, offering features like incremental parsing and precise syntax-aware editing. This improves the development experience by providing robust and dynamic syntax features, making it easier for me to navigate and manipulate code.

In order to update the language grammars, run the next command below.

In emacs, there are two packages for managing dev environments - emacs-direnv (direnv) and envrc. Direnv uses the global Emacs environment whereas envrc is buffer-local. I do not really care about this difference. What is more important to me is that emacs should not block upon handling a bigger flake.nix while setting up the dev environment. This seems to be better handled by envrc.

cape adds even more completion capabilities by adding a lot of completion logic that is exposed as separate functions. I tried out adding these to the =completion-at-points-functions= alist, but I felt like it cluttered my suggestions too much. Hence I now just call the respective functions when I need them. For this I setup the =C-z= keybinding in [[#h:218376e8-086b-46bf-91b3-78295d5d440f][General evil]].

I leave the commented out alist extensions here in case I want to try them out at some point in the future.

This package allows for swift commenting out and in of code snippets. For some reason, it is a bit broken in my config, as it sometimes comments out too much, sometimes too little, and sometimes it splits lines during commenting. Also, in org-mode when inside a src-block, it often times jumps to the top of the block.

Still, this is avery convenient package.

*** eglot
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:6cf0310b-2fdf-45f0-9845-4704649777eb
:END:

Up comes the section of lsp clients for Emacs. For a longer time, I thought that I had to choose one only, and after having started with =lsp-mode= I had tried out =lsp-booster= and then went to =eglot=. My requirements are as follow:

Must have:
  - mostly unintrusive, non-blocking
  - fast (configurable) completion
  - xref (or similar)

Nice to have:
  - Debugger
  - Multi-lsp support (running two lsp's on a single project)
  - Native Emacs support

=eglot= fills most items on the first list except for the non-blocking issue initially. It blocks sometimes on bigger projects as well as when entering directories using (nix-)direnv and the lsp is not yet loaded. The first issue is solved by using =eglot-booster=, which increases the parsing speed by what feels like a huge margin (but I never ran any actual tests). The second issue is solved with =eglot-sync-connect=, which avoids blocking the interface while the server is starting.

A blocking issue can still occur while entering a direnv that has a longer evaluation/build time. That issue can only be fixed by using Mic92's [[https://github.com/Mic92/emacs-direnv][emacs-direnv fork]], which calls direnv asynchronously, which in turn avoids the blocking. I am not using this on a daily basis however, since my environments are normally cached anyways and most of them (except for the LaTeX one) are not blocking for long enough for this to be worth it. However, I am considering spinning up my own fork of this at some point.

** Server Emacs config
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:c1e53aed-fb47-4aff-930c-dc52f3c5dcb8
:END:

On my server, I use a reduced, self-contained emacs configuration that only serves as an elfeed sync server. This is currently unused, however, I am keeping this in here for now as a reference. The big problem here was the bidirectional syncing using =bjm/elfeed-updater=. As I am using this both on a laptop client (using elfeed) as well as on a mobile phone (using elfeed-cljsrn over elfeed-web), I set up a Syncthing service to take care of the feeds as well as the db state. However, I could only either achieve changes propagating properly from the laptop to the server or from the phone to the server. Both would not work. This current state represents the state where from-laptop changes would propagate. To allow from-phone changes, change =(elfeed-db-load)= in =bjm/elfeed-updater= to =(elfeed-db-save)=.

    ###### Disclaimer

    You probably do not want to use this setup verbatim. This is made to fit my specific use cases, and I do not guarantee best practises everywhere. Changes are made on a daily basis.

    That being said, there is a lot of general configuration that you *probably* can use without changes; if you only want to use this repository as a starting point for your own configuration, you should be fine. See below for more information. Also, if you see something that can be done more efficiently or better in general, please let me know! :)

    ## Overview

    - [Literate configuration](https://swarsel.github.io/.dotfiles/) defining my entire infrastructure, including Emacs
    - Configuration based on flakes for personal hosts as well as servers on:
      - [NixOS](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs)
      - [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) only (no full NixOS) with support from [nixGL](https://github.com/nix-community/nixGL)
      - [nix-darwin](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin)
      - [nix-on-droid](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-on-droid)
    - Streamlined configuration and deployment pipeline:
      - Framework for [packages](https://github.com/Swarsel/.dotfiles/blob/main/pkgs/default.nix), [overlays](https://github.com/Swarsel/.dotfiles/blob/main/overlays/default.nix), [modules](https://github.com/Swarsel/.dotfiles/tree/main/modules), and [library functions](https://github.com/Swarsel/.dotfiles/tree/main/lib/default.nix)
      - Dynamically generated host configurations
      - Limited local installer (no secrets handling) with a supported demo build
      - Fully autonomous remote deployment using [nixos-anywhere](https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-anywhere) and [disko](https://github.com/nix-community/disko) (with secrets handling)
      - Improved nix tooling
    - Support for advanced features:
      - Secrets handling using [sops-nix](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix) (pls no pwn ❤️)
      - Management of personally identifiable information using [nix-plugins](https://github.com/shlevy/nix-plugins)
      - Full Yubikey support
      - LUKS-encryption
      - Secure boot using [Lanzaboote](https://github.com/nix-community/lanzaboote)
      - BTRFS-based [Impermanence](https://github.com/nix-community/impermanence)
      - Configuration shared between configurations (configuration for one nixosConfiguration can be defined in another nixosConfiguration)
      - Global attributes shared between all configurations to reduce attribute redeclaration

    ## Documentation

    If you are mainly interested in how I configured this system, check out this page:

    [SwarselSystems literate configuration](https://swarsel.github.io/.dotfiles/)

    This file will take you through my design process, in varying amounts of detail.

    Otherwise, the files that are possibly of biggest interest are found here:

    - [SwarselSystems.org](../SwarselSystems.org)
    - [flake.nix](../flake.nix)
    - [early-init.el](../files/emacs/early-init.el)
    - [init.el](../files/emacs/init.el)


    ### Getting started

    #### Demo configuration

    <details>
      <summary>Click here for instructions on how to install the demo system</summary>

    If you just want to see if this configuration is for you, run this command on any system that has `nix` installed:

    ``` shell
    nix run --experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' github:Swarsel/.dotfiles#swarsel-rebuild -- -u <YOUR_USERNAME>
    ```

    This will activate the `hotel` configuration on your system, which is a de-facto mirror of my main configuration with secret-based settings removed.
    Please keep in mind that this limited installer will make local changes to the cloned repository in order to be able to install it (otherwise the builder would fail at fetching my private secrets repository). As such, this should only be used to evaluate the system - if you want to use it longterm, you will need to create a fork and make some changes.
    </details>

    ### Deployment

    <details>
      <summary>Click here for deployment instructions</summary>

    The deployment process for this configuration is mostly automated, there are only a few steps that are needed to be done manually. You can choose between a remote deployment strategy that is also able to deploy new age keys for sops for you and a local installer that will only install the system without any secret handling.

    #### Remote deployment (recommended if you have at least one running system)

    0) Fork this repo, and write your own host config at `hosts/nixos/<YOUR_ARCHITECTURE>/<YOUR_CONFIG_NAME>/default.nix` (you can use one of the other configurations as a template. Also see https://github.com/Swarsel/.dotfiles/tree/main/modules for a list of all additional options). At the very least, you should replace the `secrets/` directory with your own secrets and replace the SSH public keys with your own ones (otherwise I will come visit you!🔓❤️). I personally recommend to use the literate configuration and `org-babel-tangle-file` in Emacs, but you can also simply edit the separate `.nix` files.
    1) Have a system with `nix` available booted (this does not need to be installed, i.e. you can use a NixOS installer image; a custom minimal installer ISO can be built by running `just iso` in the root of this repo)
    2) Make sure that your Yubikey is plugged in or that you have your SSH key available (and configured)
    3) Run `swarsel-bootstrap -n <CONFIGURATION_NAME> -d <TARGET_IP>` on your existing system.
      - Alternatively (if you run this on a system that is not yet running this configuration), you can also run `nix run --experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' github:Swarsel/.dotfiles -- -n <CONFIGURATION_NAME> -d <TARGET_IP>` (this runs the same program as the command above).
    4) Follow the installers instructions:
      - you will have to choose a disk encryption password (if you want that feature)
      - you will have to confirm once that the target system has rebooted
      - you will have to enter the root password once during the final system install
    5) That should be it! The installer will take care of setting up disks, secrets, and the rest of the hardware configuration! You will still have to sign in manually to some webservices etc.

    #### Local deployment (recommended for setting up the first system)

    1) Boot the latest install ISO from this repository on an UEFI system.
    2) Run `swarsel-install -n <CONFIGURATION_NAME>`
    3) Reboot

    Alternatively, to install this from any NixOS live ISO, run `nix run --experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' github:Swarsel/.dotfiles#install -- -n <CONFIGURATION_NAME>` at step 2.

    ## General Nix tips & useful links

    <details>
      <summary>Click here for a summary of nix tips & links</summary>

    - Below is a small list of tips that should be helpful if you are new to the nix ecosystem:

      - Temporarily install any package using `nix shell nixpkgs#<PACKAGE_NAME>` - this can be e.g. useful if you accidentally removed home-manager from your packages on a non-NixOS machine.
        - if you need multiple packages, you can do `nix shell nixpkgs#{<pkg1>,<pkg2>,<pkg3>}`.
        - you can set `nix.registry` to add more flakes to your registry. I use this to add a `n` shorthand to `nixpkgs`, which allows me to do `nix shell n#{<pkg1>,<pkg2>,<pkg3>}`.
      - Alternatively, use [comma](https://github.com/nix-community/comma)
        - More info on `nix [...]` commands: https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/new-cli/nix
        - some examples:
          - `nix flake update <input-name>` lets you update a specific input only.
          - `nix repl <your flake path>` gives quick insight into your written configuration.
          - `nix eval <your flake path>#<config attribute>` quickly returns an attribute in your written configuration
          - `nix fmt` formats your flake using the formatter specified under `formatter` in your `flake.nix`
      - When you are trying to setup a new configuration part, [GitHub code search](https://github.com/search?q=language%3ANix&type=code) can really help you to find a working configuration. Just filter for `.nix` files and the options you are trying to set up.
      - getting packages at a different version than your target (or not packaged at all) can be done in most cases easily with fetchFromGithub (https://ryantm.github.io/nixpkgs/builders/fetchers/)
      - you can easily install old revisions of packages using https://lazamar.co.uk/nix-versions/. You can conveniently spawn a shell with a chosen package available using `vershell <NIXPKGS_REVISION> <PACKAGE>`. Just make sure to pick a revision that has flakes enabled, otherwise you will need the legacy way of spawning the shell (see the link for more info)
      - when developing modules in a dev branch of another flake, you can use `--override-input` to temporarily use the local directory as the flake source.
      - including `nixosConfig ? config` in your module arguments is a smart way of enabling a module to pull in config from NixOS or home-manager config, no matter if it is a NixOS system or not.
      - you can have a quick cli evaluation for nix commands with e.g. `nixpgks.lib` available using `nix-instantiate --strict --eval --expr "let lib = import <nixpkgs/lib>; in <expression>"`.
      - if you are looking for a specific library, `nix-locate` makes it easy to look for them.
      - to look at the dependencies pulled in by a tool, use `nix-tree`
        - to find out which derivation uses another derivation, use `nix store --query --referrers <derivation>`
      - to get a neat overview of your config changes in recent generations, use `nix profile diff-closures --profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/system`
        - to get instead the changes since the last boot, use `nix profile diff-closures /run/*-system`
        - if you just need the generation numbers, use `sudo nix-env --list-generations --profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/system`
        - to then switch to another generation, you can use `sudo nix-env --switch-generation <generation number> -p /nix/var/nix/profiles/system` followed by `sudo /nix/var/nix/profiles/system/bin/switch-to-configuration switch`

* Appendix C: Explanations to nix functions and operators
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:8ea35dcc-ef94-4c10-9112-8be8efd6f424
:END:

This sections explains commonly used functions in nix (both builtins as well as in the nixpkgs library).
** The '//' operator
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:b1fe7a9a-661b-4446-aefa-98373108f8fd
:END:

The =//= operator in nix is used to merge attribute sets; if an attribute exists in both sets, then the latter set takes precedence:

#+begin_src bash :exports both
  swarsel-instantiate '{ a = 1; b = 2; } // { b = 3; c = 4; }'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: { a = 1; b = 3; c = 4; }

Also, this will not merge nested sets:

#+begin_src bash :exports both
  swarsel-instantiate '{ a = { a1 = 1; a2 = 2; }; b = { b1 = 1; b2 = 2; }; } // { b = { b1 = 3; b3 = 4;}; c = 4; }'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: { a = { a1 = 1; a2 = 2; }; b = { b1 = 3; b3 = 4; }; c = 4; }

 It only took the latter =b= set, even though the =b2= value was not contested. This functionality is provided by [[#h:2227ba24-e3a1-40ba-8fb8-4cab5210692a][nixpkgs.lib.recursiveUpdate]].

** builtins.listToAttrs
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:c63cd469-7724-4a05-b932-8843722a00f0
:END:

builtins.listToAttrs converts a list of name-value pairs into an attribute set.

#+begin_src bash :exports both
  swarsel-instantiate 'builtins.listToAttrs [{ name = "foo"; value = 1; } { name = "bar"; value = 2; }]'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: { bar = 2; foo = 1; }

** builtins.readDir
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:1fb6ff92-7cc1-4447-8a63-460f24633053
:END:

=builtins.readDir= reads the name of items of a directory as attributes and their type as values.

#+begin_src bash :exports both
  swarsel-instantiate 'builtins.readDir ./hosts/nixos'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: { bakery = "directory"; hotel= "directory"; milkywell = "directory"; moonside = "directory"; pyramid = "directory"; toto = "directory"; winters = "directory"; }

If you want to merge nested attribute sets, use =nixpkgs.lib.recursiveUpdate= instead of [[#h:b1fe7a9a-661b-4446-aefa-98373108f8fd][The '//' operator]]:

#+begin_src bash :exports both
  swarsel-instantiate 'lib.recursiveUpdate { a = { a1 = 1; a2 = 2; }; b = { b1 = 1; b2 = 2; }; } { b = { b1 = 3; b3 = 4;}; c = 4; }'

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:94690fcb-e039-49da-9bd3-610fa80fa08b
:END:

=nixpkgs.lib.genAttrs= is used to generate an attribute set (a dictionary-like structure) from a list of keys and a function that computes the values for those keys.

#+begin_src bash :exports both
  swarsel-instantiate 'lib.genAttrs ["a" "b" "c"] (x: "${x}-value")'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

** nixpkgs.lib.attrNames
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:0fded8e7-6160-4fcd-a491-42f0debfec52
:END:

=nixpkgs.lib.attrNames= returns the list of attribute names from an attribute set.

#+begin_src bash :exports both
  swarsel-instantiate 'lib.attrNames { a = 1; b = 2; c = 3; }'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [ "a" "b" "c" ]

** nixpkgs.lib.map
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:a4f9752a-33a6-4dd4-97ea-ef6bf340bd8e
:END:

=nixpkgs.lib.map= takes a function and applies the elements of a list upon them.

#+begin_src bash :exports both
  swarsel-instantiate 'lib.map (x: x + 1) [1 2 3]'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

** nixpkgs.lib.mkOverride
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:9e81b727-1436-4228-82b1-1edec5c50e06
:END:
=nixpkgs.lib.mkOverride= sets the priority of an expression.

If two expression are defined twice accross the configuration, the evaluator does not know which one should take precedence; this will lead to an error. By default, all option definitions are given priority 100. Lower values take precedence over lower values. For reference, here are some commonly used values:

- [[#h:16599d68-0ca5-40fa-810e-76b5c739b2b1][nixpkgs.lib.mkForce]] sets the priority to 50, which is a very low value, meaning it will be prioritised in nearly all cases
- [[#h:41180e6c-2a13-4b46-89b2-791562b4b816][nixpkgs.lib.mkDefault]] sets the priority to 1000, which is a quite high value that will almost never be used if the same attribute is defined elswheer.

** nixpkgs.lib.filter
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:38d8aecf-d997-4b50-80a2-c86314b5e67e
:END:

=nixpkgs.lib.filter= takes a list as input and only keeps elements that fulfill a given function:

#+begin_src bash :exports both
  swarsel-instantiate 'lib.filter (x: x != "a") (lib.attrNames { a = 1; b = 2; c = 3; })'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

** nixpkgs.lib.mapAttrsToList
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:b9663237-2232-4554-bc81-843be28a707c
:END:

=nixpkgs.lib.mapAttrsToList= converts an attribute set into a list by applying a given function to each name-value pair:

#+begin_src bash :exports both
  swarsel-instantiate 'lib.mapAttrsToList (name: value: "${name} = ${value}") { a = "1"; b = "2"; }'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [ "a = 1" "b = 2" ]

** nixpkgs.lib.flip
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:21389cc9-fd89-45ca-9836-592f84a45bb4
:END:


 - =nixpkgs.lib.flip= reverses the argument order passed to an expression (in semantics, that is lib.flip f a b == f b a). This is useful when an expression has one big argument and one small one; in that case it is convenient to have the shorter expression at the start of the function. Take this example of a function that simply prints its attributes as a list:

 #+begin_src bash :exports both
   swarsel-instantiate 'lib.mapAttrsToList (name: value: "${name} = ${value}") {a = "1"; b = "2";}'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [ "a = 1" "b = 2" ]

It prints the attributs unchanged, as is to be expected. If, however, we call the function using =nixpkgs.lib.flip=:

 #+begin_src bash :exports both
   swarsel-instantiate 'lib.mapAttrsToList (lib.flip (name: value: "${name} = ${value}")) {a = "1"; b = "2";}'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [ "1 = a" "2 = b" ]

** nixpkgs.lib.concatLists
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:22264e49-b6d0-4c1f-8d05-2ef1f3da3d54
:END:

=nixpkgs.lib.concatLists=, as the name suggests, concatenates lists, while keeping the original order of items:

#+begin_src bash :exports both
  swarsel-instantiate 'lib.concatLists  [ [ 1 2 ] [ 3 4 ] [ 5 ] ]'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [ 1 2 3 4 5 ]

** nixpkgs.lib.mkMerge
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:82c26445-2af4-4a6c-ae91-c804325fdf11

  - =nixpgks.lib.mkMerge= is used to deeply merge values.

#+begin_src bash :exports both

        }
      ]
    '
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

** nixpkgs.lib.foldl
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:e21d17fb-0c98-42d5-b08f-1c7584afa07f
:END:

=nixpkgs.lib.foldl= reduces an attribute set by repeatedly calling a function on an attribute set from the left.

#+begin_src bash :exports both
  swarsel-instantiate 'lib.foldl (acc: x: "(" + acc + " + " + x + ")") "0" ["1" "2" "3"]'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (((0 + 1) + 2) + 3)

similarly, there exists an version that starts from the right.

#+begin_src bash :exports both
  swarsel-instantiate 'lib.foldr (acc: x: "(" + acc + " + " + x + ")") "0" ["1" "2" "3"]'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
